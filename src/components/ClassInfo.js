            Come and join me online for a gentle flow class with a lovely
            relaxation at the end. You will receive a warm welcome and leave
            feeling refreshed, relaxed and connected. Everyone is very welcome
            and if you have never tried yoga before, come and give it a go from

            For me, yoga is not simply a physical movement of the body; it is a
            form of moving meditation, a tool for stress relief and a practice
            to help you feel more relaxed.
